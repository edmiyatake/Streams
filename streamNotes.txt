INPUT / OUTPUT STREAMS
- An I/O stream can either be an input source and an output destination
- Streams can take in or spit out different kinds of data
- A stream is a sequence of data
- A program that uses an input stream reads in data from a source, one element at a time
- A program that uses an output stream would write data to a destination, one element at a time

Conceptually:
- Input streams would take in data from a source and apply it to a program
- Output streams take data from a program and send it to a destination

BYTE STREAMS
- Programs use Byte Streams to perform input and output operations on 8-bit bytes
- Byte Stream classes are descendants of InputStream and OutputStream classes
